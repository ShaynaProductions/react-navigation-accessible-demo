# React Accessible Navigation Demonstration

This codebase is a demonstration of an accessible navigation component for React and presented in conjunction with a series of articles on DEV.
(https://dev.to/shaynaproductions)

This repository has been built with Typescript on React 19 and Next.JS 15 and will remain so. Where used, some of the base components are composed from [Adobe React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html)

## Running the Examples
You will need [the latest version of Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (at least 4.9.2) 

Once you've downloaded the repository run the following in a terminal in the project root.
yarn
yarn build
yarn dev

You will now have a fully working example site located at localhost:3000/
